GAM150 Engine Project
2D engine project to provide the students in school projects class

 

For the GAM150 class in DigiPen-KMU curriculum, a C++ base 2D custom engine is provided to the students. The engine supports necessary features for 2D game development using SDL and Box2D library.

​

Not only just implemented but also maintained and updated the engine constantly during the spring semester in 2018. Debugged and revised it with students' requests, feedback, and professors' advice.

GAM150
Engine Project
  This project was in progress from March - June 2018, when I was working as a department assistant of DigiPen-KMU curriculum.

  Basically, the engine is from scratch. The most systems are designed using SDL though, the only physics system is derived from the Box2D library.

   8 teams of 28 students worked on their project with this engine. I and professor Ly gathered feedback from the students, added new features, fixed bugs and updated new version constantly.
