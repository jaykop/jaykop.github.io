**Description:**  
This is a personal 3D game engine project.  
The main purpose of this project is to test out new C++ syntax, 3D graphics, A.I. techniques. 

**Used Languages, Libraries:**  
  * C++ (language)
  * OpenGL / GLSL (graphic engine)
  * SDL (window api)
  * IMGUI (tool)  

**Game Engine** features implemented so far:
  - Controlling window mode / fullscreen mode and size of the window
  - ***Json parser*** which loads a game scene from Json file using 
  - GUI which allows switching the game scene using imgui
  - Adding ***user-written game logic*** and register to the engine using builder pattern
  - Loading assets such as textures, audios

**3D graphics** features implemented so far:
  - ***Loading 3D models*** from wavefront obj files and render those
  - ***Particle effects*** (Normal, Explosion, Snowing/Raining)
  - 2D texture animation
  - ***Lighting effects*** (Directional light, Point Light, Spotlight)
  - Text rendering other than English

**A.I.** techniques demonstrated so far:
  - ***Finite State Machine***
    - Each agent communicates sending a message to each other
  - ***Steering behavior***
    - Flee, Arrival, Evade, Seek, Wander, Pursuit

**Technical Helps from:**
  - *Rudy Castan*
  - *Jingyu Lee*
  - *Ilkwon Ha*
  - *David Ly*
