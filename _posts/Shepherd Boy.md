Shepherd Boy
2D platformer shooting/management game providing user-oriented experience

 

This game is motivated by the story “The Shepherd Boy and The Wolf”. The player has to choose between 2 options leading to different game flow which means it is totally by the player’s decision. By managing the farm, also focusing to maintain the ability to protect the farm from wolves.

​​

My position for this project was a graphics programmer. Spent most of my time to building the 2D graphics engine from scratch supporting text rendering and particle system using OpenGL. In addition, revised game levels using playtest data and designed wandering pattern of objects to farm, attacking patterns of enemies, and random events with NPCs

  Shepherd boy is a mix of management and shooting game. The player plays as a shepherd of a farm, mainly manage resources to maintain and protect the farm from the wolves.

  The player should focus on utilizing resources to hire visitors, build fences, improve the slingshot properly. If he/she failed to make a balance, the farm will be destroyed by the wolves.

 

  The team RecycleBin of 4 team members worked on this game about 9 months from September 2015 to May 2016.  

  As a graphics programmer of this team, I implemented 2D graphics engine using OpenGL and C++. 

  The graphics engine supports the basics like the 2D sprite component, text rendering, particle effect, and transparency control.

  I also committed other important tasks of this project such as the helper visiting events, designing the types of enemy, and some of art design.
