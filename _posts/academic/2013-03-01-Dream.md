**Description:**  
<div style="text-align: justify" markdown="1">
There is a girl who lost her teddy bear, so she got out of the room to look for her precious.  
The player can get into a picture object which contains another level.  
To solve puzzles, the player should rotate the picture to change the gravity direction.  
Once the player got a key, he can make progress to the next stage.  
</div>
