&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Candlelight is a single-player, 1st person survival horror stealth game with an emphasis on light and sound. The player, trapped inside a strange temple, must remain hidden from the enemy that hunts them down, solve mysteries, and break the curse before their candle burns out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an AI programmer, I developed an **AI system using a custom Behavior Tree structure**. Also I implemented **enemy acting/animation patterns** consist of unit behaviors, debugged and code reviewed with the graphics/event system programmers.
