**Description:**  
<div style="text-align: justify" markdown="1">
Candlelight is a single-player, 1st person survival horror stealth game with an emphasis on light and sound.

**What I did for this project**  
  * Role: AI Programmer  
  * Developed ghost A.I. using ***behavior tree structure***
    - Supports dynamic update to give the flexibility to design the A.I. and prevent sameness of enemy actions
  * Modeled the ghost A.I. movements 
    - Such as chasing the player, wandering around, and through a wall
  * Debugged and code-reviewed with the graphics/event system programmers
