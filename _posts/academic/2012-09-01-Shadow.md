&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The player returns from a space station to the Earth going through every planet of the solar system. The collision detection/response and gravity direction on each level work differently by the light mode. Each level contains several types of traps, different gravity direction, and platform distribution. To clear each planet level, the player should solve the level puzzle by switching the light mode either normal or dimming mode.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked on the main mechanism of this game project, **switching collision detection/response** and **gravity direction depending on the light mode**. Additionally designed the **game levels, traps, puzzles, animations, and multiple types of player death condition**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is created by 2 people; an artist and me, the programmer. We worked on this game for about 3 months, using a given engine named 'Project Fun' from DigiPen. Most of the codes are C/C++ based and additionally I designed all the level flows and puzzles as well.
