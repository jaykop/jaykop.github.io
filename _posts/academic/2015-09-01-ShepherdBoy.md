&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This game is motivated by the story “The Shepherd Boy and The Wolf”. The player has to choose between 2 options leading to different game flow which means it is totally by the player’s decision. By managing the farm, also focusing to maintain the ability to protect the farm from wolves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shepherd boy is a mix of management and shooting game. The player plays as a shepherd of a farm, mainly manage resources to maintain and protect the farm from the wolves. The player should focus on utilizing resources to hire visitors, build fences, improve the slingshot properly. If he/she failed to make the balance, the farm will be destroyed by the wolves.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a graphics programmer of this team, I developed **2D graphics engine from the scratch using OpenGL/GLSL and C++**. The graphics engine supports the basics; **2D sprite component, text rendering, particle effect, and transparency control**. In addition, I also revised **game levels using playtest data, designed wandering pattern of objects in farm, attacking patterns of enemies, and random events with NPCs**.
