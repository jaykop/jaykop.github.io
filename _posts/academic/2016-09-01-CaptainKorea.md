**Description:**  
<div style="text-align: justify" markdown="1">
Captain Korea is a 2D top-down view, sneaking/action game which has a military theme, based on stealth action going through the enemies and traps.  
The goal of this game is to save the Republic of Korea from the evil dictator.  
<br>
The main character who is the greatest soldier in Korea must defeat and put her in jail.  
The player either can defeat the enemies with attacking skills or avoid them using sneaking skills.  
So it is totally up to the user planning how to clear the level on his/her own.
