&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in charge of base engine programmer position, developed most of the engine which takes the **entity-component design from scratch** using C++. It supports the **2D physics system**, the **user-defined component system**, the sound system using FMOD, the **data-driven feature using the JSON format** and **graphics system based on OpenGL**. Also, I committed to graphic engine codes to improve and polish based on my past experience.
