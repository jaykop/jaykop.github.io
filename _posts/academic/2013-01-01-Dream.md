<div style="text-align: justify" markdown="1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a girl who lost her teddy bear, so she got out of the room to look for her precious. The player can get into a picture object which contains another level. To solve puzzles, the player should rotate the picture to change the gravity direction. Once the player got a key, he can make progress to the next stage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a lead programmer, I implemented **rotating gravity direction** which is the main feature of this game. Also, other main tasks that I was in charge of were designing the **traps work, wandering AI of enemies**, and the art assets.
