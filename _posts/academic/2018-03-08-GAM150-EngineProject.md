<div style="text-align: justify" markdown="1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the GAM150 course, which is an game project class in DigiPen-KMU curriculum, a C++ base 2D custom engine is provided to the students. The engine supports necessary features for **2D game development using SDL graphic API and Box2D library**, and **base engine parts from scratch**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**8 teams of 28 students worked on their project with this engine**. Not only just implemented but also I and professor Ly gathered feedback/requests from the students having a session to instruct how to use the engine so that I added new features, fixed bugs, and updated new versions constantly.
