2D side-scrolling, puzzle/adventure game with a dreamlike and dark atmosphere

There is a girl who lost her teddy bear, so she got out of the room to look for her precious. The player can get into a picture object which contains another level. To solve puzzles, the player should rotate the picture to change the gravity direction. Once the player got a key, he can make a progress to the next stage.

Using C language based engine, given by DigiPen, a team of 4 worked on this project from March to June 2013. 
As a lead programmer, I implemented custom physics direction works which is the main feature of this game. Also, I designed the traps work, wandering AI of enemies., and the art assets.
