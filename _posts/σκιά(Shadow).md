σκιά(Shadow)
2D platformer, puzzle/adventure game based on the mistery/science fiction theme

​

The player returns from a space station to the Earth going through every planet of the solar system. The collision detection/response and gravity direction on each level work differently by the light mode. To clear each planet level, the player should solve the level puzzle by switching the light mode either normal or dimming mode. 

​

I worked on the main mechanism of this game project, switching collision detection/response and gravity direction depending on the light mode. Additionally designed the gameplay, traps, puzzles, animations, and multiple types of player death condition.

  Skiya is a 2D side-scrolling game with the environments of the planets in the solar system.

  The main mechanism of this game is changing collision detection/response of the platforms depends on the light mode, and the player can control it.

  Each level contains several types of trap, different gravity direction, and platform distribution. 

  The goal is simple. Go through all those obstacles and reach the exit.

 

  This project is created by 2 people; an artist and me, the programmer. We worked on this game about 3 months, using a given engine named 'Project Fun' from DigiPen.

  I implemented the in-game physics code like turning on/off the collision works and tweaking gravity direction which is the main mechanism. 

  Most of the codes are C/C++ based and additionally I designed the all the level flows and puzzles as well.
