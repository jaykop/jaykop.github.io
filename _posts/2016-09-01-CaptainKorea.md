2D top-down view action/sneaking game with powerful feedback

Captain Korea is a 2D top-down game which has a military theme, based on stealth action going through the enemies and traps. The goal of this game is to save the Republic of Korea from the evil dictator. The main character who is the greatest soldier in Korea must defeat and put her in jail.

I was a lead programmer of this project. Mainly worked on the base engine which takes the entity-component design from scratch. While designing gameplay, built 2D node-based system for the enemy path-finding algorithm. Other than that, implemented a sound system using FMOD, built data-driven system loading app configuration and level info using JSON library. 

Captain Korea is a top-down view sneaking/action game which has a military concept.
The goal of this game is clear all of the stages where the enemies and the traps are waiting for the player. 
The main character either can defeat the enemies with attacking skiils or avoid them using sneaking skills. So the player fully free to plan how to clear the level on his/her own.

I developed most of the engine and the other colleague worked on the graphics engine.
The engine is developed in C++. It supports the 2D physics system and the user-defined component system that are from scratch, the sound system using FMOD, the data-driven feature using the JSON library and graphics system based on OpenGL.
Going through this project, I learned many things even more than that I had learned so far at that time.
