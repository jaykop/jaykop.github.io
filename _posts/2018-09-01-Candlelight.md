A 1st person horror game with undertones of tragedy and a sense of powerlessness

Candlelight is a single-player, 1st person survival horror stealth game with an emphasis on light and sound. The player, trapped inside a strange temple, must remain hidden from the enemy that hunts them down, solve mysteries, and break the curse before their candle burns out.

As an AI programmer, I developed an AI system using a custom Behavior Tree structure. Also implemented enemy acting patterns consist of unit behaviors, and designed visual interface of AI system using IMGUI that allows teammates to use.
