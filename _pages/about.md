**I'm a computer programmer. Currently senior in DigiPen institute of Technology. For most of the school projects, I was in charge of base engine, graphics engine, and AI programming. Also I have fluent experience in C/C++ and custom engine development.**
  
<div style="text-align: justify"> Since 2012, I have worked on 6 projects. 2 of them were engines given, other 3 were scatch engines, and the last one is the project that I am currently working on using Unity.   </div>
<div style="text-align: justify"> Expecially, one of the custom engine projects is released to the DigiPen-KMU students in Korea for a game class. As a department assistant, implemented the most of the engine featuers using SDL, OpenGL and other 3rd party libraries in C++.   </div>
<div style="text-align: justify"> Other than that, I served to Republic of Korea Army for 2 years.  </div>
