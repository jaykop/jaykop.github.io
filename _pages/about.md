# ABOUT ME

**I'm a computer programmer. Currently senior in DigiPen institute of Technology. For most of the school projects, my position was base engine, graphics engine, and AI programming. Fluent experience in C./C++ and custom engine development.**

  Since 2012, I have worked on 6 projects. 2 of them were engines given, other 3 were scatch engines, and the last one is the project that I am currently working on using Unity.
  Expecially, one of the custom engine projects is released to the DigiPen-KMU students in Korea for a game class. As a department assistant, implemented the most of the engine featuers using SDL, OpenGL and other 3rd party libraries in C++.
   Other than that, I served to Republic of Korea Army for 2 years.
